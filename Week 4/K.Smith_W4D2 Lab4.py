#PROGRAM PROMPT:Write a program that utilizes the got_emails.csv file. Store the file data into 1D parallel lists, then use the information in
#the lists to assign additional data to each employee. Use the tables below to assign each employee in the file a unique
#email address, a department, and a unique phone extension.Once you have completed populating all eight parallel lists and displaying the five 
#required back to the user (and in the same Python file), create and write the following data for each employee to a file named westeros.csv: first name, last name, email, department, and phone extension. 
#note: each employeeâ€™s data should be on its own record (row) within
#the newly created file. You will most likely end up with an extra empty line at the end of the file (this is okay for this lab
#as we will not be reprocessing the data found in this new file).
#Once the file is ready, close it and alert the user via a displayed message. Also tell them how many employees are in the
#file, and the total count of employees for each department

#Variable Dictionary:
#total_records = total amount of records in the file.
#rd_count = rd counter
#mk_count = marketing counter
#hr_count = hr counter
#acc_count= accounting counter
#sales_count = sales counter
#audit_count = audit counter
#firstName = first name of character
#lastName = last name of character
#age = age of character
#screen_name = screen name
#house = house they are apart of 
#email =email address
#department= dept they work in
#extension = phone extension
